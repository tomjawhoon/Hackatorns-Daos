# Description about our Project

This website would serve as a platform for individuals to showcase their work, allowing others to view their talents. Through a voting system based on the principles of DAO Projects, users can register their work and receive votes. The prize money distribution would be determined by a Smart Contract, ensuring fairness. Overall, the website aims to connect talented individuals with capitalists and provide a transparent and decentralized platform for talent recognition.
